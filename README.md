## Overview

MediChain is a decentralized application (DApp) that aims to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a secure, transparent, and immutable way to store and manage medical records. By utilizing blockchain technology, MediChain ensures data privacy, security, and interoperability across different healthcare systems.

## Key Features

- **Secure Medical Records**: Records are securely stored using blockchain technology and can only be accessed by authorized personnel.
- **Patient Privacy**: Ensures that patient data is private and secure through robust encryption mechanisms.
- **Telemedicine Support**: Facilitates remote consultations and telemedicine services.
- **Transparency**: Immutable records provide a transparent and tamper-proof history of medical records.

## Setup and Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone
   cd medichain-hardhat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

To work with the project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   yarn hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   yarn hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts**:
   ```bash
   yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli
   ```

## Deployment Guide

To deploy the smart contracts to a live network, you need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file:

- `GOERLI_RPC_URL`: RPC URL of the Goerli testnet node.
- `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key of the account used for deployment.
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: API key for contract verification on Etherscan.

Example `.env` file:
```plaintext
GOERLI_RPC_URL=https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key
```

## Technology Stack

- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Secure smart contract library.
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library for Ethereum blockchain interaction.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for storing medical records.
